Welcome to the TCTrack documentation
====================================

TCTrack is a Python library providing bindings to tracking algorithms for tropical
cyclones in an accessible manner to generate high-quality and
`FAIR <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data>`_ output data.

It can be used for tracking cyclones in simularions and observations, and to compare
the output of different algorithms for a variety of data sources.
