Installation
------------

Installation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before using TCTrack ensure that any external :ref:`getting-started/index:dependencies` as required are
installed as :ref:`described below <getting-started/index:dependencies>`.

TCTrack is a Python package (Python 3.10+).
It can be obtained by cloning the repository from GitHub::

    git clone https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/TCTrack
    cd TCTrack

Installation is performed using pip, run from within the cloned source directory.
It is recommended that this is done from within a virtual environment::

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

pip can then be run to install the code from the source into the environment::

    pip install .

If you are developing TCTrack you should install as an editable package with the
additional developer dependencies::

    pip install --editable .[dev]

The `dev` optional dependencies include the `test`, `lint`, and `doc` subgroups.


Dependencies
------------

UDUNITS
~~~~~~~

TCTrack makes use of the `cf-python <https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-python/>`_ package to
generate CF-compliant NetCDF files.
This brings with it the dependency of `UDUNITS <https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/udunits/current/>`_
which needs to be installed by the user.

Binaries are available on most systems, for example on Ubuntu::

    apt-get install -y libudunits2-dev

or on mac one can use homebrew::

    brew install udunits

noting that we may need to add the library to the dynamic path e.g.::

    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/udunits/2.2.28/lib


Tracking algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use some tracking algorithms requires additional dependencies to be installed, namely
the libraries that they are wrapping.

For detailed information see the specific
:doc:`tracking algorithms documentation<../tracking-algorithms/index>`.
