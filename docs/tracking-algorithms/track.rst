TRACK
=====

TRACK is an algorithm and software for tracking and analysing tropical cyclones and
other weather systems in meteorological and oceanic data. It is developed by Kevin
Hodges and released under an AGPLv3 license.

The TRACK code can be found `on the Reading University GitLab
<https://gitlab.act.reading.ac.uk/track/track>`_ and the algorithm is described in
[Hodges2017]_.

TCTrack provides bindings to perform tropical cyclone tracking using the basic TRACK
algorithm. Other components may be added in future is required by users.

For full details of the TRACK API in TCTrack see the
