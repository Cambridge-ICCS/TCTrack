Tempest Extremes
================

Tempest Extremes is a popular software for detecting and tracking tropical cyclones
and other weather systems in climate datasets.
It is written by Paul Ullrich and released under a BSD 2-clause license.

The code can be found `on GitHub <https://github.com/ClimateGlobalChange/tempestextremes>`_,
with `online documentation available <https://climate.ucdavis.edu/tempestextremes.php>`_.

TCTrack provides bindings for tropical cyclone tracking sections of Tempest Extremes,
namely the ``DetectNodes`` and ``StitchNodes`` functionalities.
Other components may be added in future is required by users.

For full details of the Tempest Extremes API in TCTrack see the
:doc:`TCTrack Tempest Extremes API documentation <../api/tempest_extremes_api>`.

Installation
------------

Using the Tempest Extremes module in TCTrack requires Tempest Extremes to be installed
on a user's system.

The code is built using CMake.
It requires a C++ compiler and an installation of NetCDF with C++ bindings.
Full instructions for this can be found in the
`Tempest Extremes Documentation <https://github.com/ClimateGlobalChange/tempestextremes/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-via-cmake-recommended>`_
but are summarised here::

    git clone https://github.com/ClimateGlobalChange/tempestextremes.git
    cd tempestextremes/
    git checkout 5feb3a04d29fd62a1f13fa9c0b85daeefcbecd6f
    mkdir build
    cmake -B build/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_MPI=OFF .
    cmake --build build/

This will clone the Tempest Extremes code and check out the most recent commit that
TCTrack has been built against (5feb3a0 - a more recent version may work if you require
the latest features).
It will then build using CMake
Once this is complete the Tempest Extremes executeables can then be found in
``tempestextremes/build/bin/``.

To use these from TCTrack you will need to add the directory to your ``PATH`` so that
the executeables can be found at runtime::

    export PATH=$PATH:~/tempestextremes/build/bin

Note: you will need to modify this as appropriate if you cloned Tempest Extremes
somewhere other than ``~/``.

Usage
-----

Cyclone tracking in Tempest Extremes consists of two phases: node detection of candidate
storms for each snapshot in time, and stitching of nodes across timesteps to generate
tracks.

Usage of Tempest Extremes in TCTrack is done through the ``tempest_extremes`` module.

This provides the :class:`TETracker` class that stores algorithm parameters and provides
access to the methods. The detection and stitching algorithm can be configured through
the various parameters in the :class:`DetectNodesParameters` and
:class:`StitchNodesParameters` dataclasses.

In the following example we demonstrate the approach for detecting tropical cyclones as
detailed in [Ullrich2021]_. First, we set up the :meth:`~TETracker.detect_nodes`
functionality to run on a series of input files to generate output. We configure
detection to be done based on minima in psl every 6 hours, with filters based on closed
contours of psl and zgdiff, and merging of candidates within 6 degrees of one another.
Additional output fields are also added for psl, orog, and sfcWind so that they may be
used with :meth:`~TETracker.stitch_nodes`:

.. code-block:: python

    import tctrack.tempest_extremes as te

    input_files = [
        "psl_E3hr_HadGEM3-GC31-HM_hist-1950_r1i1p1f1_gn_195001010300-195006302100.nc",
        "zgdiff_Prim3hrPt_HadGEM3-GC31-HM_hist-1950_r1i1p1f1_gn_195001-195003.nc",
        "orog_fx_HadGEM3-GC31-HM_hist-1950_r1i1p1f1_gn.nc",
        "sfcWind_Prim3hr_HadGEM3-GC31-HM_hist-1950_r1i1p1f1_gn_195001010130-195006302230.nc",
    ]

    closed_contours = [
        te.TEContour(var="psl", delta=200.0, dist=5.5, minmaxdist=0.0),
        te.TEContour(var="zgdiff", delta=-6.0, dist=6.5, minmaxdist=1.0),
    ]

    output_commands = [
        te.TEOutputCommand(var="psl", operator="min", dist=0.0),
        te.TEOutputCommand(var="orog", operator="max", dist=0.0),
        te.TEOutputCommand(var="sfcWind", operator="max", dist=2.0),
    ]

    dn_params = te.DetectNodesParameters(
        in_data=input_files,
        search_by_min="psl",
        time_filter="6hr",
        merge_dist=6.0,
        closed_contours=closed_contours,
        out_header=True,
        output_commands=output_commands,
        output_file="nodes_out.dat",
    )

    te_tracker = te.TETracker(dn_params)

    run_info = te_tracker.detect_nodes()

This can then followed by StitchNodes which is set up to combine nodes into a track that
are less than 8 degrees from one another, with a track length of at least 54 hours and 8
degrees end-to-end, with up to 24 hours of missing data between adjacent nodes. This is
then filtered based upon the latitude, windspeed, and surface altitude. The format of
the ``"tracks_out.txt"`` output file is described in the documentation for
:meth:`~TETracker.stitch_nodes`:

.. code-block:: python

    threshold_filters = [
        te.TEThreshold(var="lat", op="<=", value=50, count=10),
        te.TEThreshold(var="lat", op=">=", value=-50, count=10),
        te.TEThreshold(var="orog", op="<=", value=150, count=10),
        te.TEThreshold(var="sfcWind", op=">=", value=10, count=10),
    ]

    sn_params = te.StitchNodesParameters(
        output_file="tracks_out.txt",
        caltype="360_day",
        max_sep=8.0,
        min_time="54h",
        max_gap="24h",
        min_endpoint_dist=8.0,
        threshold_filters=threshold_filters,
    )

    te_tracker = te.TETracker(dn_params, sn_params)

    run_info = te_tracker.stitch_nodes()


Finally, after running stitch nodes to generate tracks, one can write the tracks to
a NetCDF file fully compliant with the `CF-Conventions <https://cfconventions.org/>`_
(specifically the `trajectory data format <https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.11/cf-conventions.html#trajectory-data>`_)
using :meth:`~TETracker.to_netcdf`:

.. code-block:: python

    te_tracker.to_netcdf("my_cf_tracks.nc")

This can be read using any NetCDF reading utility, though
`cf-python <https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-python/>`_ will load it following the
`CF data model <https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-python/#cf-data-model>`_.

The above examples demonstrate running :meth:`~TETracker.detect_nodes`,
:meth:`~TETracker.stitch_nodes`, and :meth:`~TETracker.to_netcdf` separately. However,
it is likely that users will want to these in succession which can be done using the
:meth:`~TETracker.run_tracker` method after defining a :class:`TETracker` object with
appropriate :class:`DetectNodesParameters` and :class:`StitchNodesParameters`:

.. code-block:: python

    te_tracker = te.TETracker(dn_params, sn_params)
    te_tracker.run_tracker("my_cf_tracks.nc")

When running in this way there are certain parameters that *should not* be
set. In :class:`StitchNodesParameters`, :attr:`~StitchNodesParameters.in_fmt`
and :attr:`~StitchNodesParameters.in_file` will be determined from
:class:`DetectNodesParameters`. Also,
:attr:`~StitchNodesParameters.out_seconds` should be left ``False`` to enable
proper conversion to the netCDF output file.

If the intermediate files generated by Tempest Extremes are not of interest then the values of
:attr:`DetectNodesParameters.output_file` and :attr:`StitchNodesParameters.output_file`
can be left as ``None`` to avoid saving them.
They will instead be stored in a temporary directory that lasts for the
lifetime of the :class:`TETracker` instance.
